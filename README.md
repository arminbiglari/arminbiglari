About MeProfile HitsStars
I've been coding for 6 years and specialize in deep learning.

Since my early childhood, I have been captivated by the fascinating world of computers. This inherent curiosity steered me towards choosing computers as my focus of study in high school. I pursued a bachelor's degree in software engineering, where I delved deeper into the intricacies of programming, algorithms, and software development.

About seven years ago, during my master's degree, I discovered the exciting field of AI, and I've been hooked ever since. I've devoted myself to studying mathematics, statistics, and probability because they are the foundation of AI. With a strong understanding of these subjects, I've dived into machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP.

I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth, and I am excited to contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence and its applications in the years to come.
